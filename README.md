# Time Calculator

A simple Python script to add a duration to a given start time and calculate the resulting time, including optional considerations for days of the week.


## Description

The Time Calculator is a Python script that takes a start time, a duration, and an optional starting day as inputs and calculates the resulting time. It handles time in the format HH:MM AM/PM and can also account for days of the week.

## Features

- Addition of a duration to a start time.
- Handling of AM/PM time format.
- Optional consideration of days of the week.

## How to Use

1. Ensure you have Python installed on your system.
2. Clone the repository to your local machine.

   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/aymane66/time-calculator.git

3. Navigate to the project directory:
    ```bash
    cd time-calculator

4. Run the script using the following command:
    ```bash
    python main.py


## What I Learned

### 1. Time Handling in Python
I learned how to manipulate time in Python, including parsing time strings, performing arithmetic operations, and formatting time in a user-friendly manner.

### 2. User Input and Validation
Implementing user input and ensuring its validity were crucial aspects of this project. I explored methods to handle user input and incorporated error checking to enhance the robustness of the script.

### 3. Modular Programming
Breaking down the functionality into separate modules (`time_calculator.py` and `main.py`) allowed for a more organized and maintainable codebase.

### 4. Working with Dates and Days of the Week
Handling days of the week and calculating days later involved dealing with date-related concepts. This project provided me with hands-on experience in managing dates and understanding how they interact with time.
